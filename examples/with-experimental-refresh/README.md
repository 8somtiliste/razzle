# Razzle Experimental React Refresh Example

## How to use
Download the example [or clone the whole project](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/razzle.git):

```bash
curl https://codeload.github.com/jaredpalmer/razzle/tar.gz/master | tar -xz --strip=2 razzle-master/examples/with-experimental-refresh
cd with-experimental-refresh
```

Install it and run:

```bash
yarn install
yarn start
```

## Idea behind the example
This is a basic, bare-bones example of how to use razzle. It satisfies the entry points
`src/index.js` for the server and and `src/client.js` for the browser.

This is an **experimental** demo of React Fast Refresh.
Please do not use these features in your application or project (yet).
